# CypA_MDS
Dear Researchers,
This is a project on which molecular dynamic simulation (MDS) has done. Here, I provide you raw data obtained from MDS from both CypA mutants and CypA complexed with Sanglifehrin A, HBF-0259, and SCY-635. Data can be freely obtained. 
Sincerely

There is speardsheet comrised of affinities obtained from molecular docking of CypA complexed with almost all known CypA inhibitors either exprimentally or computationally.
